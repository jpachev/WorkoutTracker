I’m a senior in the computer science program (graduating in December) and am also doing a business minor. I’m interested in this project because the idea seems really cool and useful! 

I don’t have a ton of experience with working with databases beyond CS 240, but I’m a hard worker and a quick learner. I’ve done some work with both MongoDB and node.js, and I know enough about MySQL and Vue.js to feel good about using those technologies for this project.

The business/legal parts sound good to me! There’s definitely a huge market for fitness technology right now and any data that we collect could be super valuable.
